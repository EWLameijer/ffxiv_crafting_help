class: while adventurers must start as a class (like marauder or conjurer), for gear purposes classes are too similar to
jobs, so I just use the term "job". Which also has the advantage that Kotlin, like many programming languages, also has
a class keyword.

job: I use job for both the 'real' jobs like paladin or carpenter and for classes, as for gear purposes, classes are
basically the same as jobs.
